# Kibo Faculty Class Scheduler

The objective of this assignment is to develop an AI agent to assist Kibo in scheduling live classes for instructors. The process is as follows:

- Each instructor will provide their available time slots.
- Each instructor is assigned to teach a specific course.
- Classes cannot be scheduled on weekends or Fridays.
- Each class will be scheduled for a duration of 2 hours.
- There can be a maximum of 2 classes per day with at least a 1-hour break between them.

Here is a sample of the input data for October 2023:

```
course,taught_by,time_slots
PROG1,Mohammed,Tues:12:00-15:00,Wed:12:00-15:00
OOP,David,Mon:16:00-20:00,Tues:16:00-20:00,Wed:16:00-20:00,Thurs:16:00-20:00
MT,Santiago,Mon:14:00-18:00,Tues:14:00-18:00,Wed:14:00-18:00,Thurs:14:00-18:00
CSys,David,Mon:16:00-20:00,Tues:16:00-20:00,Wed:16:00-20:00,Thurs:16:00-20:00
TSP,Mohammed,Tues:12:00-15:00,Wed:12:00-15:00
WAD,Olaperi,Mon:14:00-18:00,Tues:14:00-18:00,Wed:14:00-18:00
ML,Wasiu,Wed:14:00-18:00,Thurs:16:00-20:00
```

Your task is to write a program that will generate a schedule for the October 2023 semester. The output must be in the following format:

```
{'course1': 'time_slot', 'course2': 'time_slot', ...}
```

Example:

```
{'PROG1': 'Tues_12:00-14:00', 'OOP': 'Mon_16:00-18:00', 'MT': 'Mon_14:00-16:00', 'CSys': 'Tues_16:00-18:00', 'WAD': 'Wed_14:00-16:00', 'ML': 'Thurs_16:00-18:00'}
```

The main function that will be called is `schedule_classes`. You must have the same function signature as shown below, otherwise, your code will not pass the tests.
    
```python
def schedule_classes(courses):
    pass
```

Example of the data that will be passed to the function:

```python
courses_timeslots = [("PROG1", ["Tues_12:00-14:00", "Wed_13:00-15:00"]),
              ("OOP", [
                  "Mon_16:00-18:00", "Tues_16:00-18:00", "Wed_16:00-18:00",
                  "Thurs_16:00-18:00"
              ]),
              ("MT", [
                  "Mon_14:00-16:00", "Tues_14:00-16:00", "Wed_14:00-16:00",
                  "Thurs_14:00-16:00"
              ]),
              ("CSys", [
                  "Mon_16:00-18:00", "Tues_16:00-18:00", "Wed_16:00-18:00",
                  "Thurs_18:00-20:00"
              ]),
              ("WAD",
               ["Mon_14:00-16:00", "Tues_16:00-18:00", "Wed_14:00-16:00"]),
              ("ML", ["Wed_14:00-16:00", "Thurs_16:00-18:00"])]

```

Sample output:

```python
{'PROG1': 'Tues_12:00-14:00', 'OOP': 'Mon_16:00-18:00', 'MT': 'Mon_14:00-16:00', 'CSys': 'Tues_16:00-18:00', 'WAD': 'Wed_14:00-16:00', 'ML': 'Thurs_16:00-18:00'}
```
